    "# What is Mongodb?\n",
    "MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL).MongoDB is a document database with the scalability and flexibility that you want with the querying and indexing that you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The document model maps to the objects in your application code, making data easy to work with\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ad hoc queries, indexing, and real time aggregation provide powerful ways to access and analyze your data\n",
    "\n",
    "4. MongoDB is a distributed database at its core, so high availability, horizontal scaling, and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## WHAT YOU CAN DO\n",
    "### Work with your data in MongoDB?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Store and query your data\n",
    "2. Transform data with Aggregations.\n",
    "3. Sexure access to your data\n",
    "4. Deploy and scale your database.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is MongoDB Database?\n",
    "MongoDB database is structured NoSQL database. In this, data are not stored in the table, rows and coloumn, instead it is stored in documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Document Structure\n",
    "MongoDB documents are composed of field-and-value pairs and have the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "   field1: value1,\n",
    "\n",
    "   field2: value2,\n",
    "\n",
    "   field3: value3,\n",
    "\n",
    "   ...\n",
    "\n",
    "   fieldN: valueN\n",
    "   \n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of a field can be any of the BSON data types, including other documents, arrays, and arrays of documents. For example, the following document contains values of varying types:\n",
    "\n",
    "var mydoc =\n",
    "\n",
    " {\n",
    "               _id: ObjectId(\"5099803df3f4948bd2f98391\"),\n",
    "\n",
    "               name: { first: \"Alan\", last: \"Turing\" },\n",
    "\n",
    "               birth: new Date('Jun 23, 1912'),\n",
    "\n",
    "               death: new Date('Jun 07, 1954'),\n",
    "\n",
    "               contribs: [ \"Turing machine\", \"Turing test\", \"Turingery\" ],\n",
    "\n",
    "               views : NumberLong(1250000)\n",
    "\n",
    "   }\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The above fields have the following data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "_id holds an ObjectId.\n",
    "name holds an embedded document that contains the fields first and last.\n",
    "birth and death hold values of the Date type.\n",
    "contribs holds an array of strings.\n",
    "views holds a value of the NumberLong type.\n",
    "Field Names\n",
    "Field names are strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documents have the following restrictions on field names:\n",
    "\n",
    "The field name _id is reserved for use as a primary key; its value must be unique in the collection, is immutable, and may be of any type other than an array. If the _id contains subfields, the subfield names cannot begin with a ($) symbol.\n",
    "Field names cannot contain the null character.\n",
    "The server permits storage of field names that contain dots (.) and dollar signs ($).\n",
    "MongodB 5.0 adds improved support for the use of ($) and (.) in field names. There are some restrictions. See Field Name Considerations for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Collection - an organized store of documents in MongoDB usually with common fields between documents. There can be many collections per database and many documents per collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
